Create a professional and clean README.md in Markdown format for a simple personal webpage project. The project typically includes just an `index.html` file, but may also include optional `style.css` and `script.js` files. The README should:

- Have a short and clear title
- Briefly describe the purpose of the site
- Mention what technologies are used (HTML, optional CSS/JS)
- Explain how to open or run the site (locally in browser)
- Be useful for people who are just uploading static sites
- Be short and to the point (no overcomplication)

Only return the Markdown output.
